- There are no bad ideas until there are.
This is in a way borrowed from every other time I have had a course teach brainstorming to me. The idea being while in the early stages of brainstorming no ideas should get shot down in order to avoid accidentally shooting down a good idea or to prevent a team member from feeling that their contribution isn't being taken seriously.

- Weight the cons then the pros.
After brainstorming is wrapping up some of the ideas will need to get eliminated. I believe it is important to go through the cons and then the pros. The reason for this is that people often have a strong emotional attachment to their favorite idea from a brainstorming session. Considering the cons first allows the group to take a more objective approach to eliminating options. After considering the cons the pros of an idea can be useful to break ties between options with similar flaws. 

- Know when to quit.
When making a prototype it is important to know when it is good enough. Spending too much time on something that was only ever mean to be a proof on concept can result in wasted time and energy. It is important to stop directly working on and improving your product periodically and ask yourself if it fulfills your needs for demonstrating the desired functionality.
